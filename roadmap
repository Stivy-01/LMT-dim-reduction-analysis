1. Data Preparation
Copy
- Organize behavioral data into format:
  * Rows: Individual subjects (mice) × days
  * Columns: Behavioral measurements
  * Shape: (n_subjects * n_days) × n_behaviors
- Ensure no missing values
- Apply quantile normalization per batch/day
2. Initial Data Processing
Copy
1. Normalize each behavioral measure:
   - Use quantile normalization
   - Transform to normal distribution (probit function)
   - Do this separately for:
     * Each behavioral measure
     * Each batch
     * Each day

2. Create behavioral vectors:
   - For each mouse (m)
   - For each day (d)
   - Format: b(m)d = [b₁(m)d, b₂(m)d, ..., bₙ(m)d]
3. Calculate Variance Matrices
Copy
# Pseudocode for variance calculations
def calculate_variances(data):
    # Within-cluster variance (Σw)
    Σw = sum([
        sum([
            (x_md - mean_m) @ (x_md - mean_m).T 
            for d in days
        ]) 
        for m in mice
    ])
    
    # Between-cluster variance (Σb)
    Σb = D * sum([
        (mean_m - global_mean) @ (mean_m - global_mean).T 
        for m in mice
    ])
    
    return Σw, Σb
4. Apply LDA
Copy
1. Solve eigenvalue problem:
   - Find eigenvectors of Σw⁻¹Σb
   - Select top eigenvectors based on eigenvalues
   - These form projection matrix W

2. Project data:
   - Transform original behavioral vectors using W
   - Results in lower-dimensional ID space
5. Extract Individual IDs
Copy
1. Project behavioral vectors:
   idm = EID · <b(m)>d
   where:
   - EID is projection matrix
   - <b(m)>d is average across days

2. Validate results:
   - Check separation between individuals
   - Verify stability across days
6. Quality Control Steps
Copy
1. Verify assumptions:
   - Normal distribution after normalization
   - Sufficient separation between groups
   
2. Check stability:
   - Cross-validation across days
   - Test reproducibility

3. Evaluate results:
   - Fisher-Rao discriminant score
   - Classification accuracy
Implementation Notes
Copy
Key Parameters to Track:
1. Number of behavioral measures (original dimensionality)
2. Number of subjects
3. Number of days/observations per subject
4. Number of retained dimensions in final ID space
5. Eigenvalue threshold for dimension selection
Validation Metrics
Copy
1. Within-individual stability:
   - Correlation across days
   - Within-individual variance

2. Between-individual separation:
   - Fisher-Rao discriminant
   - Classification accuracy

3. Reproducibility measures:
   - Split-half reliability
   - Test-retest reliability
