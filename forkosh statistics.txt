1. Permutation Tests (Non-Parametric)
Widely used throughout the paper to assess the significance of their findings, especially for comparing identity domains (IDs) and verifying stability over time or after manipulations.
Why?
No assumption of normality.
More robust for small sample sizes or data that may not follow a standard distribution.
Example: Used to test the self-similarity of ID scores between baseline and after mixing the groups (Supplementary Fig. 4 and Fig. 2c).
2. One-Sample t-Test
Applied when comparing observed variance explained by ID scores with a distribution of shuffled ID scores (to determine if the true variance explained was significantly higher than expected by chance).
Example: Used in the RNA-seq analysis to assess the variance explained by IDs across the transcriptome​
.
3. Linear Regression and R² Analysis
Used in multiple analyses to assess the predictive power of ID scores in relation to classical behavioral tests and gene expression.
Example:
Fig. 3c: Linear regression between ID1 scores and social dominance (David’s score) with an exceptionally high R² = 0.72.
Gene expression analysis: ID scores were used as predictors in a linear model for transcriptomic variance.
4. ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)
Used in parametric comparisons where the data distribution was assumed to be normal.
Example: Comparisons of behavioral scores across multiple IDs or experimental groups when normality was verified.
5. Pearson’s Correlation
Used for evaluating the relationship between ID scores and classical behavioral readouts.
Example: Fig. 3a, where the strength of correlation between each ID and specific behavioral readouts is represented in a heatmap.
